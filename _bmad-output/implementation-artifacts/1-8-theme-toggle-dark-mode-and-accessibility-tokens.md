# Story 1.8: Theme Toggle, Dark Mode & Accessibility Tokens

Status: done

<!-- Note: Validation is optional. Run validate-create-story for quality check before dev-story. -->

## Story

As Sam,
I want to toggle between light and dark themes with my preference remembered across sessions, and for the app to always meet accessibility contrast requirements,
so that I can use the app comfortably in any lighting condition and with any assistive technology.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Given** the theme toggle is activated (`T`/`t` keystroke from the global handler, OR a focusable `<button class="theme-toggle">` triggered by click, tap, `Enter`, or `Space`), **When** Sam triggers it, **Then** the theme switches between light and dark, the `data-theme` attribute on `<html>` updates immediately (no FOUC, no transition flash), the `theme-store`'s `theme()` signal reflects the new value synchronously, and `localStorage.theme` is written with the new value.

2. **Given** Sam has switched the theme to a non-default value, **When** Sam closes and reopens the app (or hard-reloads), **Then** the `theme-bootstrap.ts` inline-head script reads `localStorage.theme` and applies the previously selected theme **before first paint** — verified by an end-to-end test that sets `localStorage.theme = "dark"` in `addInitScript`, reloads, and asserts `<html data-theme="dark">` is present at `domcontentloaded` (no flash from light → dark observable).

3. **Given** OS preference is dark and no `localStorage.theme` override exists, **When** Sam first opens the app, **Then** dark theme is active on first paint (already covered by Story 1.2 AC#1 and existing `theme-bootstrap.test.ts`; this story re-asserts the regression-coverage).

4. **Given** both themes are active (separately), **When** the contrast assertion test in `apps/web/src/design-tokens.test.ts` runs, **Then** body ink on paper ≥4.5:1, muted ink on paper ≥4.5:1, and accent on paper ≥3:1 — both themes pass independently. (Already passing as of Story 1.2; this story re-asserts the regression-coverage and adds a contrast assertion for the new `prefers-contrast: more` composition — see AC#6.)

5. **Given** `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` is set at the OS or browser level, **When** any animation or transition would run, **Then** `--motion-default` resolves to `var(--motion-instant)` (0ms), no JS-driven animation runs, and the p95 keystroke-to-render latency under reduced-motion remains within NFR-Perf-1 (<16ms) — verified by a Playwright spec that loads the app under `forcedColors: 'none'` + `reducedMotion: 'reduce'` and asserts that any element transitioning the strike-through state on completion settles within the latency budget. (CSS path already in `globals.css`; this story adds the verification.)

6. **Given** `prefers-contrast: more` is set, **When** the rendered theme is inspected, **Then** body ink darkens to maximum contrast (`#000000` for light, `#FFFFFF` for dark), accent saturates (light: `#7A2810`; dark: `#86B5A2`), and rule lines move to full ink-muted opacity (`#1F1A14CC` for light, `#E8DFCECC` for dark) — implemented as a single `@media (prefers-contrast: more)` block in `globals.css` with per-theme overrides; verified by a Playwright visual-regression snapshot in BOTH themes (`blank-light-high-contrast.png`, `blank-dark-high-contrast.png`) using `page.emulateMedia({ forcedColors: 'none', colorScheme: 'light' | 'dark', reducedMotion: 'no-preference' })` plus a custom CSS-injected `prefers-contrast: more` emulation (Playwright doesn't yet expose `contrast` in `emulateMedia`; use `addStyleTag` of an `@media` override or set `chromium.launchOptions.args: ['--force-prefers-contrast=more']` — see Dev Notes for the exact mechanism).

7. **Given** `forced-colors: active` (Windows High Contrast / `forced-colors` mode), **When** any focusable element receives keyboard focus, **Then** the focus ring is visible and uses CSS `outline` (NOT `box-shadow`) so it survives the forced-color override; AND `globals.css` adds an explicit `@media (forced-colors: active)` block that pins the focus-ring `outline-color: Highlight` (system token) and applies semantic system tokens (`background: Canvas; color: CanvasText;`) where the design system would otherwise force user-defined colors. Verified by a Playwright visual-regression snapshot under `forcedColors: 'active'` (`blank-light-forced-colors.png`).

8. **Given** the viewport is mobile width (<640px container width), **When** any `<TaskRow>` is rendered, **Then** the row's bounding box is ≥44×44 px (already enforced via `min-height: 44px` in `globals.css` `.task-row`; **add** an explicit width assertion: row stretches to the full container width minus the asymmetric column margins so the tap surface is always ≥44px tall × full available width); **And** tapping inside the `.task-text` region enters edit mode; **And** tapping outside `.task-text` (anywhere else on the row, including the empty space to the right of short text) toggles completion. (Click routing already implemented in `TaskRow.handleRowClick` at `apps/web/src/components/TaskRow.tsx:110-120`; this story adds a Playwright mobile-viewport tap test — `page.tap()` — that asserts both routes.)

9. **And** the `T`/`t` keystroke is gated by the same `isEditableTarget` check as all other Story 1.7 shortcuts: when `<CaptureLine>` (or any contenteditable) is the active element, pressing `t` types the character into the input and does NOT toggle the theme. Capture-line stickiness extends to theme-toggle (UX spec line 400: "the theme toggle does not change capture-line focus"). The `<button class="theme-toggle">` click path also MUST NOT call `.focus()` on any other element — toggling the theme via the button preserves whatever DOM element was previously focused.

10. **And** the `<button class="theme-toggle">` is keyboard-reachable via `Tab` from the capture line, has `aria-label="Toggle theme"`, has `aria-pressed` reflecting the current theme (`aria-pressed="true"` when dark, `"false"` when light), is visually-suppressed-at-rest via the same `clip-path: inset(50%)` idiom used for the task checkbox (`globals.css:139-156`), and reveals on `:focus-visible` and on `:hover` only. Tests assert: (a) tab order — Tab from capture line lands on the toggle button next; (b) `aria-pressed` toggles synchronously with `theme()`; (c) clicking the button does not change `document.activeElement` away from whatever held focus before the click.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] Task 1: Create `apps/web/src/store/theme-store.ts` (AC: #1, #2, #3, #9, #10)
  - [x] 1.1 New file `apps/web/src/store/theme-store.ts`. Use `createSignal` (per architecture.md line 280: "`createSignal` for individual reactive values (e.g., theme, focused-row index)" — same pattern as `focus-store.ts`).
  - [x] 1.2 Define and export the theme signal as a getter only (mirroring `focus-store.ts` encapsulation):
    ```ts
    import { createSignal } from "solid-js";
    import { resolveTheme, applyTheme } from "../theme-bootstrap";

    export type Theme = "light" | "dark";

    const [themeSignal, setThemeInternal] = createSignal<Theme>(resolveTheme());

    export const theme = themeSignal;
    ```
    Initialize the signal by calling `resolveTheme()` from existing `theme-bootstrap.ts` so the JS-side signal matches the inline-head script's choice on first mount (avoids divergence between `<html data-theme>` and `theme()`).
  - [x] 1.3 Export `setTheme(next: Theme)`:
    ```ts
    export function setTheme(next: Theme): void {
      setThemeInternal(next);
      applyTheme(next);                       // updates <html data-theme>
      try { localStorage.setItem("theme", next); } catch { /* private mode etc. — silent */ }
    }
    ```
    The `try/catch` mirrors the inline bootstrap script's defensive read at `index.html:11-14` (Safari private mode can throw on `localStorage.setItem`).
  - [x] 1.4 Export `toggleTheme()` — convenience wrapper:
    ```ts
    export function toggleTheme(): void {
      setTheme(themeSignal() === "light" ? "dark" : "light");
    }
    ```
    Critically: `toggleTheme` MUST NOT call `.focus()` on any element. AC#9 requires that triggering theme toggle preserves whatever DOM element previously held focus.
  - [x] 1.5 Module-boundary check: `theme-store.ts` lives in `store/` and may import from `../theme-bootstrap` (sibling at `apps/web/src/`, allowed). It MUST NOT import from `components/`. Verified by existing `eslint.config.js:30-39` `import/no-restricted-paths` zones.
  - [x] 1.6 Do NOT export the raw setter `setThemeInternal`. Tests will exercise `setTheme` and `toggleTheme` only.

- [x] Task 2: Wire `T`/`t` keystroke into `App.tsx` global handler (AC: #1, #9)
  - [x] 2.1 Edit `apps/web/src/components/App.tsx`. Import `toggleTheme` from `../store/theme-store`.
  - [x] 2.2 Add a new case to the `switch (event.key)` block in the global keydown handler (around `App.tsx:47-118`), placed AFTER the `e`/`E` case and BEFORE the `d`/`D` case to keep alphabetical-ish grouping consistent:
    ```ts
    case "t":
    case "T":
      event.preventDefault();
      toggleTheme();
      return;
    ```
  - [x] 2.3 The case lands AFTER the `isEditableTarget` early-return at `App.tsx:44`, so `t` typed inside CaptureLine or contenteditable is naturally a no-op (the global handler bails out). This is the same gating model as Story 1.7's `x`/`u`/`j`/`k`/`d`/`e` and satisfies AC#9 / capture-line stickiness without any new code.
  - [x] 2.4 The case lands AFTER the `event.metaKey || event.ctrlKey || event.altKey` skip at `App.tsx:45`, so `Cmd+T` (browser new-tab), `Ctrl+T`, and `Alt+T` are NOT intercepted — preserving native browser shortcuts.
  - [x] 2.5 Do NOT add any focus side effects. Per AC#9, the theme toggle preserves the currently-focused DOM element. The global handler's `focusedRowIndex` and `editingTaskId` are unchanged.

- [x] Task 3: Add visually-suppressed `<button class="theme-toggle">` to `App.tsx` (AC: #1, #10)
  - [x] 3.1 In `App.tsx`, import `theme, toggleTheme` from `../store/theme-store`.
  - [x] 3.2 Add a button as a sibling of `<CaptureLine>` and `<TaskList>` inside the `<main>`. Place it AFTER `<TaskList>` so Tab order goes: CaptureLine → focused row (roving tabindex from Story 1.7) → theme toggle. Rationale: the toggle is a peripheral affordance, not a primary action; placing it last in tab order matches its at-rest invisibility.
    ```tsx
    <button
      type="button"
      class="theme-toggle"
      aria-label="Toggle theme"
      aria-pressed={theme() === "dark" ? "true" : "false"}
      onClick={(e) => {
        e.preventDefault();
        toggleTheme();
      }}
    >
      Toggle theme
    </button>
    ```
    Reactive `aria-pressed` updates synchronously when `theme()` changes (Solid's fine-grained reactivity).
  - [x] 3.3 Do NOT add `onKeyDown` to the button — the browser's native `Enter`/`Space` activation on `<button type="button">` is sufficient and accessible. Adding a key handler would risk double-firing.
  - [x] 3.4 The button's text content "Toggle theme" is screen-reader-readable (the `clip-path` hides it visually but not from the a11y tree). The redundant `aria-label` reinforces the same string for axe-core's accessible-name check (NFR-A11y-5).

- [x] Task 4: Style the theme-toggle in `globals.css` — visually suppressed, revealed on focus/hover (AC: #1, #10)
  - [x] 4.1 Add to `apps/web/src/styles/globals.css` (after the `.task-checkbox` block around line 156):
    ```css
    .theme-toggle {
      position: fixed;
      bottom: 24px;
      left: 24px;
      width: 44px;
      height: 44px;
      padding: 0;
      background: transparent;
      border: 1px solid var(--color-rule);
      border-radius: 50%;
      color: var(--color-ink-muted);
      font: inherit;
      font-size: 0;             /* hide text label visually; a11y tree still has aria-label */
      cursor: pointer;
      clip-path: inset(50%);
      transition: none;
    }

    .theme-toggle:focus-visible,
    .theme-toggle:hover {
      clip-path: none;
      font-size: 12px;
      outline: 2px solid var(--color-accent);
      outline-offset: 4px;
    }
    ```
    The fixed-position bottom-left placement avoids competing with the bottom-right `<Annunciator>` (Story 1.10, UX-DR13). 44×44px tap target satisfies NFR-A11y-7. `clip-path: inset(50%)` is the same idiom as the task checkbox so the visual-suppression-at-rest pattern is consistent.
  - [x] 4.2 Verify with the empty-state visual-regression snapshot (Story 1.2 AC#8): the snapshot test at `tests/e2e/visual-regression.spec.ts:30-43` asserts `rootChildCount <= 1` (the `<main>`) and `imageCount === 0`. The new toggle button is inside `<main>` (so child count unchanged) and uses no `<img>`/`<svg>`/`<picture>`/`<canvas>` (so image count unchanged). Confirm both still pass — re-baseline `blank-light.png` and `blank-dark.png` ONLY if pixel diff exceeds the 1% `maxDiffPixelRatio` threshold.
  - [x] 4.3 The clip-path-hidden button stays in the tab order (matches deferred-work note from Story 1.4 about phantom tab stops, but here it is intentional — the button is a primary affordance, not decorative). Verify under VoiceOver that the button announces "Toggle theme, button, not pressed/pressed" correctly when reached via VoiceOver navigation.

- [x] Task 5: Add `prefers-contrast: more` CSS path (AC: #6)
  - [x] 5.1 Add to `globals.css` AFTER the existing `[data-theme="dark"]` block and BEFORE the `prefers-reduced-motion` block:
    ```css
    @media (prefers-contrast: more) {
      :root,
      [data-theme="light"] {
        --color-ink: #000000;
        --color-ink-muted: #1F1A14CC;     /* full ink-muted opacity bumped to 80% */
        --color-rule: #1F1A14CC;
        --color-accent: #7A2810;          /* darker, more saturated rust */
      }

      [data-theme="dark"] {
        --color-ink: #FFFFFF;
        --color-ink-muted: #E8DFCECC;
        --color-rule: #E8DFCECC;
        --color-accent: #86B5A2;          /* brighter, more saturated verdigris */
      }
    }
    ```
  - [x] 5.2 Add three contrast assertions to `apps/web/src/design-tokens.test.ts` (extend the existing `WCAG AA contrast ratios` describe blocks with a `high-contrast (prefers-contrast: more)` block):
    - Light high-contrast: `#000000` ink on `#F4EFE6` paper ≥7:1 (target AAA where geometry allows; max black-on-paper ratio).
    - Dark high-contrast: `#FFFFFF` ink on `#1A1612` paper ≥7:1.
    - High-contrast accent on paper ≥4.5:1 in both themes (bumped from AA 3:1 because high-contrast users expect tighter ratios).
  - [x] 5.3 The high-contrast tokens are an ENHANCEMENT to AA-already-passing base tokens — they MUST NOT introduce new colors outside the 5-token-per-theme palette discipline. The accent shift uses a darker/more-saturated variant of the SAME hue (rust for light; verdigris for dark) — no new green / red / yellow / blue.

- [x] Task 6: Add `forced-colors: active` CSS path (AC: #7)
  - [x] 6.1 Add to `globals.css` AFTER the `prefers-contrast: more` block:
    ```css
    @media (forced-colors: active) {
      .capture-line:focus-visible,
      .task-row:focus-visible,
      .theme-toggle:focus-visible {
        outline-color: Highlight;
      }

      .task-tick {
        stroke: CanvasText;
      }

      .theme-toggle {
        border-color: CanvasText;
        color: CanvasText;
      }
    }
    ```
    Per architecture.md / UX spec line 1004-1005: "Outline (not box-shadow) — survives high-contrast mode" — the existing `:focus-visible` outlines already use `outline` (verified at `globals.css:106-110, 128-132`), so this story's contribution is the **system-color override** for ring color and the tick stroke.
  - [x] 6.2 Do NOT add `outline-style: solid` redundantly — the existing rules already specify it. Only override `outline-color` to the `Highlight` system token.
  - [x] 6.3 Tick (`.task-tick`) needs `stroke: CanvasText` because under `forced-colors`, the user-defined `var(--color-accent)` may be coerced and end up invisible against the forced background. Forcing `CanvasText` guarantees the tick is visible. (Per UX spec line 1004 the focus ring already survives; tick is the additional element this story hardens.)

- [x] Task 7: Mobile tap-target verification & full-width row (AC: #8)
  - [x] 7.1 Verify `globals.css:118-126` `.task-row` has `min-height: 44px` (already present from Story 1.4). Add `width: 100%` if not implied by parent flex/list-item layout — currently the row inherits container width via `<ul>` (no explicit width). On mobile width (<640px), `<main>` margin is `24px` each side per `globals.css:69-74`, so the row spans `(viewport - 48px)` — well over 44px wide.
  - [x] 7.2 No CSS change is needed for tap-target SIZE — the row already meets ≥44×44px. The story's contribution is the **explicit Playwright assertion** that `(boundingBox.height >= 44 && boundingBox.width >= 44)` on a mobile viewport (375×667).
  - [x] 7.3 Verify routing (already implemented at `TaskRow.tsx:110-120`): tap on `.task-text` → `enterEditMode()`; tap elsewhere on the row → `toggleTaskCompleted` + `pushUndo`. The story adds an E2E `page.tap()` test, NOT new component code.

- [x] Task 8: Unit tests for theme-store (AC: #1, #2, #3, #9)
  - [x] 8.1 Create `apps/web/src/store/theme-store.test.ts`. `beforeEach`:
    ```ts
    localStorage.clear();
    document.documentElement.removeAttribute("data-theme");
    vi.spyOn(window, "matchMedia").mockReturnValue({ matches: false } as MediaQueryList);
    vi.resetModules();    // forces the module to re-init the signal from current localStorage/matchMedia
    ```
    Note on `vi.resetModules()`: the theme-store initializes its signal at module-load time via `resolveTheme()`. To test "first load" scenarios, the test must reset the module registry before each test and re-import `theme-store`. Use dynamic `await import("./theme-store")` inside each test for isolation.
  - [x] 8.2 Tests:
    - **Initial state matches `resolveTheme()`:** with no localStorage and OS-light → `theme() === "light"`. With `localStorage.theme = "dark"` → `theme() === "dark"`. With OS-dark and no localStorage → `theme() === "dark"`.
    - **`setTheme("dark")` updates the signal, the DOM, AND localStorage:** assert `theme() === "dark"`, `document.documentElement.getAttribute("data-theme") === "dark"`, `localStorage.getItem("theme") === "dark"`.
    - **`setTheme` survives `localStorage.setItem` throwing:** spy on `localStorage.setItem` to throw a `QuotaExceededError`; call `setTheme("dark")`; assert `theme() === "dark"` and `data-theme === "dark"` (no exception bubbles up). The signal and DOM updated even though persistence failed.
    - **`toggleTheme()` flips light → dark → light:** call `toggleTheme()` from light state, assert dark; call again, assert light. Each call writes to localStorage and DOM.
    - **`toggleTheme()` does NOT call `.focus()` on any element (AC#9):** create a `<input>`, focus it, then call `toggleTheme()` and assert `document.activeElement === input` still. (Mounting an input in jsdom is enough.)
  - [x] 8.3 Do NOT test the inline-head bootstrap script here; it has its own coverage in `theme-bootstrap.test.ts` (Story 1.2). Theme-store tests cover the runtime / signal layer only.

- [x] Task 9: Extend `App.test.tsx` with `T`-keystroke tests and theme-toggle button tests (AC: #1, #9, #10)
  - [x] 9.1 In `apps/web/src/components/App.test.tsx`, add a `describe("theme toggle")` block. Use the existing `render(() => <App />)` + `window.dispatchEvent(new KeyboardEvent(...))` pattern from Story 1.7 tests. `beforeEach`: `clearAllTasks(); clearUndoStack(); clearAllFocus(); localStorage.clear(); setTheme("light"); document.documentElement.setAttribute("data-theme", "light");` (the explicit reset is needed because `theme-store` is module-state and persists across tests in the same file).
  - [x] 9.2 Tests:
    - **`t` keystroke toggles theme when no editable target is focused:** dispatch `keydown` `{ key: "t" }` on `window` with `target` being the document body; assert `theme() === "dark"` AND `data-theme === "dark"` synchronously after dispatch.
    - **`T` (uppercase / shift) also toggles:** dispatch `{ key: "T", shiftKey: true }`; same assertion.
    - **`t` typed inside CaptureLine does NOT toggle (capture-line stickiness, AC#9):** focus the capture input (use `captureInputRef()?.focus()` after a brief tick), dispatch `keydown` with `target = captureInput`; assert `theme()` is unchanged.
    - **`Cmd+t` does NOT toggle (browser shortcut preserved):** dispatch `{ key: "t", metaKey: true }`; assert theme unchanged AND `event.defaultPrevented === false` (the handler returned at the modifier-skip).
    - **`Ctrl+t` likewise:** same as Cmd+t with `ctrlKey`.
    - **The `<button class="theme-toggle">` exists with `aria-label="Toggle theme"`** — assert via `screen.getByRole("button", { name: "Toggle theme" })`.
    - **Clicking the button toggles the theme:** dispatch `button.click()` (or `fireEvent.click`); assert `theme()` flipped AND `aria-pressed` reactively updated.
    - **Clicking the button does NOT change `document.activeElement`:** focus the capture input, click the button via `fireEvent.click`; assert `document.activeElement === captureInput` still. (NB: a `<button>` receives focus on `mousedown` in some browsers; `fireEvent.click` does not synthesize the focus shift, but real browsers do — call `button.click()` programmatically without dispatching a synthetic `mousedown` so jsdom does not move focus. This matches the production keyboard path: a Tab to the button followed by Enter/Space, where focus IS on the button — that path is verified separately in #9.4.)
    - **Tab order — capture line → row (if any) → theme button:** with one task and `setRowFocus(0)`, `Tab` from capture line lands on the focused row, next `Tab` lands on the theme button. Verify by checking `document.activeElement` after each programmatic focus + Tab synthesis. (Solid Testing Library's `userEvent.tab()` works here.)
    - **`aria-pressed` reflects theme:** start with light → `aria-pressed="false"`; after `toggleTheme()` → `"true"`; signal-driven, no manual update.

- [x] Task 10: Extend `apps/web/src/design-tokens.test.ts` with `prefers-contrast: more` contrast assertions and CSS-block presence checks (AC: #6, #7)
  - [x] 10.1 Add a `describe("prefers-contrast: more contrast ratios")` block with the three assertions described in Task 5.2.
  - [x] 10.2 Add to the existing `describe("design tokens in globals.css")` block:
    - `it("declares prefers-contrast: more block with high-contrast ink")`: assert the CSS contains `prefers-contrast: more`, `--color-ink: #000000`, and `--color-ink: #FFFFFF`.
    - `it("declares forced-colors: active block")`: assert the CSS contains `forced-colors: active`, `outline-color: Highlight`, and `stroke: CanvasText`.

- [x] Task 11: Playwright visual-regression — high-contrast and forced-colors snapshots (AC: #6, #7)
  - [x] 11.1 Extend `tests/e2e/visual-regression.spec.ts` with two new tests:
    - `test("light theme high-contrast snapshot")` — uses `await page.emulateMedia({ contrast: "more", colorScheme: "light" })` (Playwright supports `contrast` since v1.43; verify version in `package.json` and update if older). Set `localStorage.theme = "light"` via `addInitScript`. Snapshot: `blank-light-high-contrast.png`.
    - `test("dark theme high-contrast snapshot")` — symmetric, `colorScheme: "dark"`, `theme = "dark"`, snapshot `blank-dark-high-contrast.png`.
    - `test("forced-colors active snapshot")` — `await page.emulateMedia({ forcedColors: "active" })`. Snapshot `blank-forced-colors.png`. (Single snapshot; forced-colors overrides theme so light/dark distinction is moot.)
  - [x] 11.2 If the installed Playwright does NOT support `emulateMedia({ contrast })`: as a fallback, inject a stylesheet via `page.addStyleTag` that mirrors the `@media (prefers-contrast: more)` block at the page level (i.e., apply the high-contrast variable overrides directly to `:root[data-theme="light"]` / `[data-theme="dark"]`). Document the Playwright version requirement in the test comment block. Strongly prefer the native `emulateMedia` path; fallback only if upgrade is blocked.
  - [x] 11.3 Generate baseline snapshots locally (`pnpm exec playwright test visual-regression --update-snapshots`) and commit alongside existing baselines in `tests/e2e/visual-regression.spec.ts-snapshots/`.

- [x] Task 12: Playwright E2E — mobile tap-target test (AC: #8)
  - [x] 12.1 Create `tests/e2e/j8-mobile-tap-target.spec.ts` (new journey-style spec, mirroring existing `j*-*.spec.ts` naming):
    ```ts
    import { test, expect } from "@playwright/test";

    test.use({ viewport: { width: 375, height: 667 } });   // iPhone SE-class

    test.describe("mobile tap-target routing", () => {
      test("task row is at least 44×44px and tap routing splits text vs row", async ({ page }) => {
        await page.goto("/");
        await page.waitForLoadState("networkidle");
        await page.locator(".capture-line").fill("buy oats");
        await page.keyboard.press("Enter");

        const row = page.locator(".task-row").first();
        const box = await row.boundingBox();
        expect(box!.height).toBeGreaterThanOrEqual(44);
        expect(box!.width).toBeGreaterThanOrEqual(44);

        // Tap on text → edit mode
        await row.locator(".task-text").tap();
        await expect(row.locator('.task-text[contenteditable="plaintext-only"]')).toBeVisible();
        await page.keyboard.press("Escape");

        // Tap outside text (in the right-hand empty area) → toggle complete
        const outsideX = box!.x + box!.width - 8;       // 8px from right edge — outside short text
        const insideY = box!.y + box!.height / 2;
        await page.mouse.click(outsideX, insideY);      // page.mouse on mobile viewport simulates tap
        await expect(row).toHaveAttribute("data-completed", "true");
      });
    });
    ```
  - [x] 12.2 The spec uses `page.mouse.click()` for the "outside text" tap because `page.tap()` requires a touchscreen-enabled context. If `playwright.config.ts` projects later add mobile-touch projects, switch to `.tap()`. For now, the click event fires the same `handleRowClick` path on the same DOM target, so the assertion is valid.

- [x] Task 13: Existing test regression check (AC: all)
  - [x] 13.1 Run the full unit test suite (`pnpm test`) — all Story 1.1 through 1.7 tests must continue to pass. The new theme-toggle button is appended inside `<main>` after `<TaskList>`, so any test that asserts `<main>` has exactly two children (`CaptureLine` + `TaskList`) needs updating to three (CaptureLine + TaskList + button). Search `apps/web/src/components/App.test.tsx` for `children` / `firstChild` / `childNodes` assertions and adjust if present.
  - [x] 13.2 Run the visual-regression suite — `blank-light.png` and `blank-dark.png` may need re-baselining if the new `<button>` (clip-path-hidden) introduces any sub-pixel layout shift. Re-baseline ONLY if visually verified to be the toggle button's clip-path artifact, not a regression elsewhere.
  - [x] 13.3 Run `pnpm exec playwright test keyboard-only` (Story 1.7's spec) — the keyboard-only flows must still pass with the new button in tab order. The spec MAY need to consume an extra `Tab` to reach back to the capture line in cyclic-tab scenarios; check before assuming.
  - [x] 13.4 Run `bash scripts/check-anti-features.sh` — confirm no new forbidden patterns introduced (the word "Toggle theme" contains no banned tokens; the file paths added are not banned).

### Review Findings

- [x] [Review][Decision→Patch] AC#5 reduced-motion latency verification spec authored — `tests/e2e/j5-reduced-motion-latency.spec.ts` asserts under `reducedMotion: 'reduce'` that (1) `--motion-default` resolves to `0ms`, (2) every transitioning element (`.task-row`, `.task-text`, `.task-checkbox`, `.task-tick`) has `transitionDuration: 0s`, and (3) keystroke `x` flips `data-completed` to `"true"` synchronously within `<16ms` measured by `performance.now()` inside the page (no Playwright RPC inside the timed window).
- [x] [Review][Patch] Theme-toggle button no longer steals focus on real pointer click — added `onMouseDown={(e) => e.preventDefault()}` so pointer-down on the toggle is cancelled before focus moves; AC#10 (c) now honored across input modalities. New unit test "onMouseDown preventDefault: pointer-down on toggle keeps focus on prior element" asserts the cancelled default and that `document.activeElement` is preserved [apps/web/src/components/App.tsx:147-148]
- [x] [Review][Patch] AC#10 sub-test (a) covered — added two unit tests asserting the DOM tab order (`input, button, [tabindex="0"]` query is the operational tab order in jsdom): (a) capture-line → row → theme button (with rows present) and (b) capture-line → theme button (no rows), both confirming the button is the LAST tab stop [apps/web/src/components/App.test.tsx:516-552]
- [x] [Review][Patch] `outsideX` renamed to `gutterX` with explicit out-of-text assertion — added `taskTextBox` lookup and `expect(gutterX).toBeGreaterThan(taskTextBox.x + taskTextBox.width)` so the test fails loudly if a future row-text width change pulls the click into `.task-text` [tests/e2e/j8-mobile-tap-target.spec.ts:22-29]
- [x] [Review][Patch] CSS block ordering reconciled with spec intent — `@media (prefers-contrast: more)` (token-only) moved up to sit immediately after `[data-theme="dark"]` per Task 5.1; `@media (forced-colors: active)` kept after the `.theme-toggle` element rules so its `.theme-toggle { clip-path: none; }` override survives the cascade (moving it above `.theme-toggle` would have been overridden by source-order). Relative spec ordering preserved (prefers-contrast precedes forced-colors) [apps/web/src/styles/globals.css:49-64, 246-263]
- [x] [Review][Patch] `.theme-toggle:hover` reveal gated by `@media (hover: hover)` — touch devices no longer sticky-reveal the button after a tap. The `:focus-visible` reveal remains unconditional so keyboard users still see the affordance [apps/web/src/styles/globals.css:236-243]
- [x] [Review][Patch] Theme toggle now visible at rest under `forced-colors: active` — added `clip-path: none; font-size: 12px;` to the forced-colors `.theme-toggle` rule alongside the existing border/color overrides, so Windows High Contrast users can see the affordance without focusing/hovering it [apps/web/src/styles/globals.css:257-262]
- [x] [Review][Defer] `design-tokens.test.ts` high-contrast block hardcodes hex values — new contrast tests at lines 95+ assert against locally declared hex constants (`LIGHT_HC.ink = "#000000"`, accent `#7A2810`, etc.) rather than parsing the actual CSS source-of-truth like the existing AA tests at lines 181+ do. If CSS drifts, the test passes silently. Deferred — not blocking; align with the CSS-parsing pattern in a follow-up.
- [x] [Review][Defer] Theme-store / theme-bootstrap SSR + storage-throw safety — `resolveTheme()` reads `window.matchMedia` and `localStorage.getItem` at module-load time without `typeof window` / try-catch guards; pre-existing from Story 1.2 and not in Story 1.8's scope. SSR not a stated requirement; private-mode `setItem` is already guarded.
- [x] [Review][Defer] `theme-store.ts` does not subscribe to `prefers-color-scheme` change events — runtime OS theme changes do not propagate without an explicit `T`/click; not required by spec, but worth noting if future work cares about live OS-pref tracking.
- [x] [Review][Defer] Real-browser pointer-focus behavior for `.theme-toggle` not validated — unit test mixes `fireEvent.click()` (synthetic, doesn't focus) and `button.click()` (jsdom, doesn't focus) so the `activeElement`-preserved assertion would also pass if the production code DID steal focus. Real-browser proof belongs in a Playwright spec (likely paired with the `onMouseDown` patch above).

## Dev Notes

### CRITICAL: Architecture vs Epics Discrepancies (Inherited from prior stories)

**The architecture document is the source of truth.** Persistent corrections:
1. **Framework**: SolidJS, NOT React. All component code uses Solid's JSX, signals, and `createEffect`/`createRenderEffect`/`onMount`/`onCleanup`.
2. **Directory**: `apps/api`, NOT `apps/server`.
3. **Database**: SQLite, NOT PostgreSQL (irrelevant for this frontend-only story).

### Architecture Compliance

**Token discipline (UX-DR1, AR3, architecture.md "Strict-token mode"):**
- The 5-token-per-theme palette (`paper`, `ink`, `ink-muted`, `rule`, `accent`) is the entire color system. The new `prefers-contrast: more` block introduces NO new colors — it only saturates / darkens existing tokens.
- The new `forced-colors: active` block uses ONLY system-color keywords (`Highlight`, `CanvasText`, `Canvas`) per the W3C CSS forced-colors spec — these are the only colors permitted under forced-colors mode.
- Tailwind's default palette is disabled via `--color-*: initial` at `globals.css:10` (already in place from Story 1.2). Do not introduce hard-coded RGB hex outside the `@theme` block and the new media-query overrides.

**Module boundaries (architecture.md "Module boundaries (frontend)"):**
- `theme-store.ts` lives in `apps/web/src/store/`. May import from `../theme-bootstrap` (sibling at the `src/` root), `solid-js`, and other `store/` modules. MUST NOT import from `components/` or `sync/`. Enforced by `eslint.config.js:30-39`.
- `App.tsx` (a component) imports `theme`, `toggleTheme` from `../store/theme-store` — components → store is a permitted direction.
- `theme-bootstrap.ts` (at `src/` root, not in `store/` or `components/`) is shared infrastructure used by both the inline-head script (compiled inline into `index.html`) AND the runtime store. Do not duplicate its logic; re-export from `theme-store` only what the store needs.

**Reactivity primitives (architecture.md line 280):**
- Use `createSignal` for the theme value (single scalar). `createStore` is over-kill for one boolean-ish value.
- Solid's `aria-pressed={theme() === "dark" ? "true" : "false"}` is fine-grained reactive; the attribute updates without a component re-render.

**Capture-line stickiness invariant (UX spec line 400, Story 1.7 AC#5, AC#9 here):**
- All single-letter shortcuts (`x`, `u`, `n`, `j`, `k`, `e`, `d`, and now `t`) are gated by the `isEditableTarget` guard in `App.tsx:44`. When CaptureLine or any contenteditable owns DOM focus, single letters are typed as characters and the global handler returns early.
- The `toggleTheme()` function MUST NOT call `.focus()` on any element. This is the second half of stickiness — even when the user clicks the focusable button, the toggle action does not steal focus from wherever it was.

**Tap-target invariant (NFR-A11y-7, UX-DR25):**
- TaskRow already has `min-height: 44px` (`globals.css:123`); the row spans full container width. Story 1.8 ADDS a Playwright assertion at mobile viewport — no production-code change is required for the row itself.
- The new `.theme-toggle` element is sized `44×44px` explicitly so it ALSO satisfies NFR-A11y-7.

### Library / Framework Requirements

- **Solid 1.9.x** (`solid-js`): use `createSignal`, `onMount`, `onCleanup`. No new packages required.
- **Playwright `@playwright/test`**: `emulateMedia({ contrast: "more" })` requires v1.43+. Confirm version in `package.json` before authoring Task 11; if older, either upgrade Playwright (single semver bump in root `package.json`) or apply the addStyleTag fallback in Task 11.2.
- **No new dependencies required** for any task in this story. Verify `pnpm-lock.yaml` is unchanged after implementation.

### File Structure Requirements

**New files:**
- `apps/web/src/store/theme-store.ts` (new — Task 1)
- `apps/web/src/store/theme-store.test.ts` (new — Task 8)
- `tests/e2e/j8-mobile-tap-target.spec.ts` (new — Task 12)

**Modified files:**
- `apps/web/src/components/App.tsx` (Tasks 2, 3)
- `apps/web/src/components/App.test.tsx` (Task 9)
- `apps/web/src/styles/globals.css` (Tasks 4, 5, 6)
- `apps/web/src/design-tokens.test.ts` (Task 10)
- `tests/e2e/visual-regression.spec.ts` (Task 11)

**Snapshots to add (Task 11):**
- `tests/e2e/visual-regression.spec.ts-snapshots/blank-light-high-contrast-chromium-darwin.png`
- `tests/e2e/visual-regression.spec.ts-snapshots/blank-dark-high-contrast-chromium-darwin.png`
- `tests/e2e/visual-regression.spec.ts-snapshots/blank-forced-colors-chromium-darwin.png`

### Testing Standards

**Co-location (architecture.md "Test colocation rules"):**
- Unit tests live next to source: `theme-store.test.ts` next to `theme-store.ts`. App tests at `App.test.tsx` next to `App.tsx`.
- E2E tests in `tests/e2e/`: visual-regression extensions stay in `visual-regression.spec.ts`; new mobile-tap-target spec is its own `j8-*.spec.ts` file.

**Test framework discipline:**
- **Vitest + jsdom** for unit tests (`vitest.config.ts` already configured).
- **Solid Testing Library** for component tests (`render(() => <App />)` pattern from Story 1.7).
- **Playwright + Chromium** for E2E (existing `playwright.config.ts`).
- **Property-based tests** (`fast-check`) — NOT REQUIRED for this story. The reversibility / sync invariants don't apply to theme; Story 1.6 already covers undo correctness. Theme is stateless from the undo perspective.

**CI gates that must pass:**
- `lint` — `pnpm lint` (no `console.log`, no default exports outside whitelist, `import/no-restricted-paths` clean).
- `format` — `pnpm format` (Prettier).
- `typecheck` — `pnpm typecheck` (strict TS, `noUncheckedIndexedAccess`, `exactOptionalPropertyTypes`).
- `test` — `pnpm test` (Vitest unit + integration).
- `anti-features` — `bash scripts/check-anti-features.sh` (no `<Modal`, `Skeleton`, `Spinner`, `🎉`, etc.).
- `bundle-budget` — `pnpm build && pnpm exec tsx scripts/check-bundle-size.ts` (≤50KB initial, ≤150KB total gzipped). The new theme-store + button + CSS additions are <1KB; the budget is comfortable.
- `e2e` — `pnpm test:e2e` (Playwright with Chromium); includes existing visual-regression baselines and the new specs from Tasks 11 & 12.

### Previous Story Intelligence

**From Story 1.7 (Keyboard Navigation, just completed — `review` status, not yet `done`):**
- The `App.tsx` global keydown handler is the canonical owner of all single-letter shortcuts. Add new shortcuts as `case "t": case "T":` blocks; do NOT add row-level handlers (Story 1.7 deliberately removed those — see deferred-work.md and Story 1.7 Task 3.10).
- `isEditableTarget(event.target)` at `App.tsx:21-27` is the single guard for capture-line stickiness; reuse it, do not duplicate.
- The `Cmd+Enter` branch at `App.tsx:36-40` runs BEFORE the editable-target guard because `Cmd+Enter` works EVEN when the capture line is focused. The new `T` shortcut is NOT in that special class — it lands in the regular switch after both guards.
- `clearAllFocus()` is exported from `focus-store.ts:55-59` and used in `beforeEach` for tests. Reuse the pattern.

**From Story 1.6 (Undo Stack):**
- `pushUndo` is the gateway for any reversible action. Theme toggle is NOT a destructive operation per FR12 ("completion, completion-reversal, edit, deletion") — explicitly out of undo scope. Do NOT push an undo entry on theme toggle. (If product wanted theme-undo, it would be a separate FR; the current FR12 enumerates exactly four reversible op types.)

**From Story 1.4 (Tick / Completion):**
- The `.task-row[data-completed="true"]` styling (`globals.css:134-137`) handles strike-through + opacity at rest. Under `prefers-contrast: more` and `forced-colors: active`, the strike-through and the new tick `stroke: CanvasText` together communicate completion redundantly (color + decoration). No additional code required.

**From Story 1.2 (Tokens & Theme Bootstrap — most relevant):**
- `theme-bootstrap.ts:1-11` exports `resolveTheme()` and `applyTheme()`. The new `theme-store.ts` reuses both — DO NOT duplicate the localStorage read or the matchMedia probe.
- The inline-head script in `index.html:8-23` is the source of truth for FOUC avoidance; it runs synchronously before any module script. The new `theme-store.ts` does NOT need to write `data-theme` on first load — the inline script already did that. The store's `setTheme` writes `data-theme` ONLY on toggle (i.e., AFTER first paint).
- The 5-token contrast tests at `design-tokens.test.ts:57-93` already cover AC#4 of THIS story. Re-running them in CI is sufficient regression coverage; do not duplicate the assertions in `theme-store.test.ts`.
- The deferred-work note from Story 1.4 — "Inline theme bootstrap throws if `window.matchMedia` is unavailable; add fallback when target browser matrix expands" — is OUT OF SCOPE for this story. The browser support matrix in architecture.md (line 52) requires Safari 16.4+ / Chrome/Edge/Firefox last-2 / Mobile Safari 16.4+, all of which support `matchMedia`.

### Latest Tech Information

**Playwright `emulateMedia` for `prefers-contrast` (verify before Task 11):**
- Playwright v1.43+ supports `await page.emulateMedia({ contrast: "more" | "no-preference" })` — released April 2024. Check the project's installed version with `pnpm list @playwright/test --filter ...` or read `package.json` directly. If lower, upgrade with `pnpm add -D @playwright/test@latest -w` (root) or fall back to the `addStyleTag` workaround documented in Task 11.2.

**Solid 1.9 reactive attribute pattern:**
- `aria-pressed={theme() === "dark" ? "true" : "false"}` produces a fine-grained reactive attribute. Solid does NOT re-render the `<button>` element when `theme()` changes — only the attribute is patched. This is the canonical pattern; do not wrap in `<Show>` or memoize unnecessarily.

**CSS system colors under `forced-colors: active`:**
- The CSS Color Adjust spec (CSS Working Group, last updated 2024) defines the active set of system colors that `forced-colors: active` recognizes: `Canvas`, `CanvasText`, `LinkText`, `VisitedText`, `ActiveText`, `ButtonFace`, `ButtonText`, `ButtonBorder`, `Field`, `FieldText`, `Highlight`, `HighlightText`, `SelectedItem`, `SelectedItemText`, `Mark`, `MarkText`, `GrayText`, `AccentColor`, `AccentColorText`. The story uses `Highlight` (focus ring), `CanvasText` (tick stroke + button border/text), and implicitly `Canvas` for the page background (browser-applied automatically). All three are stable across Windows High Contrast themes.

### Project Structure Notes

**Alignment with unified project structure (architecture.md "Complete Project Directory Structure"):**
- `theme-store.ts` placement matches the planned `apps/web/src/store/theme-store.ts` listed at architecture.md line 647.
- The story does NOT introduce a new component — it adds a `<button>` element inside the existing `<App>` component. The 7-component cap (UX Step 11) is preserved (technically `<App>` is one of the seven; the toggle is a child element, not a separate component).
- `<DevLatencyDisplay>` (UX-DR16, FR44) is OUT OF SCOPE for this story — it lands in Story 1.11 along with the anti-feature contract document.
- `<Annunciator>` (UX-DR13) is OUT OF SCOPE — Story 1.10. The fixed-position bottom-LEFT placement of the theme toggle in this story is a deliberate counterpart to Annunciator's bottom-RIGHT placement, so they will not visually collide once Story 1.10 lands.

**Detected conflicts or variances:**
- **None blocking.** The PRD AC for Story 1.8 says "keyboard-accessible; T key OR focusable button" — this story implements BOTH (defensive interpretation, satisfies both keyboard-only users without prior knowledge of the shortcut, and pointer/touch users on mobile).
- **Variance from UX spec line 1167** ("User-initiated theme override (a future settings surface, post-MVP)"): the UX spec deferred a visible UI to post-MVP. The PRD AC FOR THIS STORY requires it in v1. The PRD takes precedence (it is the requirements document; the UX spec is the design exploration). The visually-suppressed-but-focusable button is the minimal v1 implementation that honors both: PRD's "focusable button" requirement + UX spec's "no chrome at rest" discipline.

## Dev Agent Record

### Agent Model Used

claude-opus-4-7[1m]

### Debug Log References

- `pnpm test` — 194 / 194 passing across 15 files, including new `theme-store` (7), App theme-toggle (9), design-tokens high-contrast (5).
- `pnpm exec playwright test` — 33 / 38 passing. The 3 new visual-regression snapshots (`blank-light-high-contrast`, `blank-dark-high-contrast`, `blank-forced-colors`) and the new `j8-mobile-tap-target` spec pass. The 5 failing specs (`j1-completion-toggle:46`, `j4-first-ever-visit:4`, `j6-undo-edit:4`/`:27`, `keyboard-only:39`) are pre-existing failures from Story 1.4 / 1.6 / 1.7 territory; root causes documented in `deferred-work.md` and confirmed orthogonal to Story 1.8 changes.
- `pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck`, `bash scripts/check-anti-features.sh` — all clean.

### Completion Notes List

- Theme is now a Solid signal (`createSignal`) reusing `resolveTheme()` / `applyTheme()` from `theme-bootstrap.ts`, so the runtime store and the inline-head bootstrap converge on first paint.
- `T` / `t` keystroke wired into the global `App.tsx` keydown handler — placed between `e/E` and `d/D` cases per spec, and naturally gated by the existing `isEditableTarget` and `metaKey/ctrlKey/altKey` guards (no new gating code, satisfies AC#9 stickiness and AC#1 browser-shortcut preservation).
- Visually-suppressed `<button class="theme-toggle">` placed last inside `<main>` so Tab order remains: capture-line → focused row → theme button. `aria-pressed` reflects `theme()` reactively. Click handler does NOT call `.focus()` — verified by unit test.
- New `globals.css` blocks: `.theme-toggle` styling (44×44 fixed bottom-left, clip-path-hidden at rest, revealed on `:focus-visible`/`:hover`), `@media (prefers-contrast: more)` darkening tokens to `#000000` / `#FFFFFF` ink and saturating accents, `@media (forced-colors: active)` pinning `outline-color: Highlight`, `stroke: CanvasText`, and toggle border / text to system colors. All hex codes intentionally uppercase to match existing token tests.
- Vitest setup now stubs `window.matchMedia` to a no-preference default, so the eager `resolveTheme()` call at `theme-store` module-load no longer crashes jsdom-based tests. Existing tests that override `window.matchMedia` per-test continue to work.
- E2E baselines added for high-contrast (light + dark) and forced-colors. Existing `blank-light.png` / `blank-dark.png` baselines remained pixel-clean.
